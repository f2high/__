-t <num>, --threads <num>
                      Number of threads (per worker)
-r <range> [<range> ...], --range <range> [<range> ...]
                      Range(s) of group IDs
-p <file>, --proxy-file <file>
                      File containing HTTP proxies
-c <id>, --cut-off <id>
                      ID limit for skipping missing groups
-C <size>, --chunk-size <size>
                      Number of groups to be sent per batch request
-T <seconds>, --timeout <seconds>
                      Timeout for connections and responses
```
# --cut-off
By default, when encountering a missing/deleted group, it's ID will be removed from the queue so that it won't be checked again.

The `--cut-off` argument specifies at which ID (and above) missing groups shouldn't be removed from the queue. This is ideal in scenarios where you also wanna scan groups that haven't been created yet.
